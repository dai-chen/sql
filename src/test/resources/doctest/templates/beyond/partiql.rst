Introduction
============

PartiQL is a SQL-compatible query language that makes it easy and efficient to query semi-structured and nested data regardless of data format. For now our OpenDistro For Elasticsearch SQL plugin is partially compatible with PartiQL specification. More support and integration will be provided in future.
